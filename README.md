# NUS-RightShip Hackathon Project: GHG Emissions Analysis in Singapore's Ports

## Overview
In this project, we conducted analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (mainly CO2) in Singapore's ports as part of the NUS-RightShip Hackathon. Our goal was to gain a deeper understanding of maritime sustainability challenges and contribute to efforts to address them.

## Approach
We utilized Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to handle data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The process involved:

- **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the datasets for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Analysis**: Following the given instructions to calculate CO2 Emissions and Electrical Demand. Also Exploring the data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations related to GHG emissions.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative visualizations to effectively communicate our findings.

## Insights
Through our analysis, we were able to uncover valuable insights into the factors contributing to GHG emissions in Singapore's ports. These findings have the potential to inform strategies for reducing emissions and promoting sustainability in maritime operations.
